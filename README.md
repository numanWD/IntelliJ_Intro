# IntelliJ Introduction

Introduction to IntelliJ IDEA the Java IDE

## Intro

### What is a IDE?

An **integrated development environment** (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates the basic tools developers need to write and test software. 
Typically, an **IDE** contains a **code editor**, a **compiler** o **interpreter** and a **debugger** that the developer accesses through a single graphical user interface (GUI).

### Why we need it?

We need it to help us to write better.

* Quickly navigating to a type without needing to worry about namespace, project etc
* Navigating to members by treating them as hyperlinks
* Autocompletion when you can't remember the names of all members by heart
* Automatic code generation
* Refactoring (massive one)
* Organise imports
* Warning-as-you-type (i.e. some errors don't even require a compile cycle)
* Hovering over something to see the docs
* Keeping a view of files, errors/warnings/console/unit tests etc and source code all on the screen at the same time in a useful way
* Ease of running unit tests from the same window
* Integrated debugging
* Integrated source control
* Navigating to where a compile-time error or run-time exception occurred directly from the error details.
* ...

#### Code Analysis

An IDE performs code analysis by applying inspections to your code.
The inspections detect not only compiling errors, but also different code inefficiencies. Whenever you have some unreachable code, unused code, non-localized string, unresolved method, memory leaks or even spelling problems â€“ you'll find it very quickly.

### Why we choose IntelliJ?

JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA is cross-platform. It is great, quick, flexible and have thousands of personalisations and plugins.
